It allows you to create a hierarchy to describe user interactions with a system.</p>\n<h2>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Upon receiving a certification (from Amazon for example), the burden of proof lies with whomever is trying to verify that you hold that certification. A propsective employer would need to contact Amazon and provide the number associated with your certification to verify that you actually received it.</p>\n<p>SmartCert utilizes the blockchain to make this process trust-less. The certifications are distributed from an issuer address to a holder address. Verification then becomes as simple as signing a message to prove ownership of the address holding the certification.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./smartcert.png\" alt=\"SmartCert\"></p>\n<h2>Stack</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a> was used to build the views and display blockchain data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://redux.js.org/\">Redux</a> was used as the state container along with <a href=\"https://github.com/trufflesuite/drizzle\">Drizzle</a> to sync with the state of the deployed smart contract. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://solidity.readthedocs.io/\">Solidity</a> was used to develop the smart contract containing the business logic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://truffleframework.com/\">Truffle</a> was used to deploy SmartCert on the Ropsten test net.</p>\n<h1>Contribute</h1>\n<p>Iâ€™m open to any and all contribution!
