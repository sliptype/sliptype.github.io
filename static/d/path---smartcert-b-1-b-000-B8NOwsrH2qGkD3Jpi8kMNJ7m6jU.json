A respective employer would need to contact Amazon and provide the number associated with your certifaction to verify that you actually received it.</p>\n<p>SmartCert utilizes the blockchain to make this process trust-less. The certifismartcations are distributed from an issuers address to a holders address. Verification then becomes as simple as signing a message to prove ownership of the address holding the certification.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/smartcert-07be73c98449aac3220a166f71e6ddd1-59341.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 43.417085427135675%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"SmartCert\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/smartcert-07be73c98449aac3220a166f71e6ddd1-fb8a0.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/smartcert-07be73c98449aac3220a166f71e6ddd1-1a291.png 148w,\n/static/smartcert-07be73c98449aac3220a166f71e6ddd1-2bc4a.png 295w,\n/static/smartcert-07be73c98449aac3220a166f71e6ddd1-fb8a0.png 590w,\n/static/smartcert-07be73c98449aac3220a166f71e6ddd1-526de.png 885w,\n/static/smartcert-07be73c98449aac3220a166f71e6ddd1-59341.png 995w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Stack</h2>\n<p> It uses the following tech:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>React/Redux </li>\n<li>Solidity (Ethereum)</li>\n<li>Truffle</li>\n<li>Drizzle</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad\nCommas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text\ndidn’t listen.
